Weld Tree Farm 

The Weld Tree Farm is a project designed to help understand how climate change will alter the timing of key plant events such as leafout, flowering and growth. It is ‘common garden’ meaning that it is a collection of individual plants taken from different environments. The plants in this garden were grown from seed collected at four sites stretching from Harvard Forest (Petersham, Massachusetts) to Saint Hippolyte, Quebec. By growing the plants together under a common climate we can better understand how plant species respond to climate across a suite of geographically distant sites, and thus can better predict how the plants may change with continued climate change across the locations that they grow currently. The garden includes 14 major canopy and understory tree and shrub species common in northeastern forests. For more information visit temporalecology.org.
