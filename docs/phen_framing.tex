%cjc2024Sept25: I think Lizzie and Deirdre already hit the highlights for the Intro for now. I agree that there are paragraphs that need to be moved to the Results and Discussion (anything that includes the figures). I also think you need to set up the experiement a bit better in why it's so cool. A little more development on the latitudinal gradient would be good, even if the results aren't exciting, it'd be great to set up our initial hypothesis more. And maybe get into trees vs shrubs and interannual variation. This was a massive endeavor, I want the reader to be excited about it. 

\section{Introduction}
Carbon uptake by terrestrial plants is a major determinant of Earth's climate system \citep{} (say more precisely). In mid and high latitudes, the net carbon uptake is primarily determined by the length of the growing season \citep{}. Because climate change has advanced spring leafout, widely considered the start of the growing season \citep{} it has been suggested that earlier start of season should translate into a longer growing season and, therefore, more net carbon uptake by terrestrial ecosystems \citep{}. However we haven't really seen this in the data \citep{}. % Quantifying carbon uptake by terrestrial plants is a critical aspect of climate forecasting, and therefore it is critical to understand the relationship between phenology, growing seasons and carbon storage.

%emw2024Sep19 -- I would make this paragraph a bit more about the current literature which I *think* has a lot about productivity driving EOS dynamics ... Something like: Increasing research has suggested that plants adjust their end of season timing dynamically such that longer seasons do not increase total productivity, but the mechanism or consistency of this effect is unclear (Cite Zani and Norby response to Zani, cite Zohner 2023 solstice). New proposals include that plants somehow adjust mid-season based on a combination of growing season heat and daylength (cite Zohner 2023 solstice) while other work suggests a potential fundamental connection between SOS and EOS [don't use EOS and SOS, please, I am just doing it to be quick] (someone said this I am sure? Found some cites below). These phenological carryover effects (positive associates between phenological phases) are prevalent \citep{} but weaken over the season \citep{}, so it is unlikely variation in SoS and EoS are perfectly correlated. This is reinforced by the observations that calendar growing seasons have indeed gotten longer with climate change \citep{}. 
%emw2024Sep19 -- We should cite Zani et al. (Increased growing-season productivity drives earlier autumn leaf senescence in temperate trees) here. Also, has Richardson or anyone shown SOS and EOS correlations? Some citations to check out for SOS and EOS correlations ...

%dl2024Setp20: I agree with the above, I think there could also be more background on the mechanism/cues of carbon assimilation to set up why calendar vs thermal growing season could differ

One possible reason that earlier spring phenology many not increase net carbon assimilation (choose a term and stick with it) is if an early start of growing season results in an earlier end of the growing season. These phenological carryover effects (positive associates between phenological phases) are prevalent \citep{} but weaken over the season \citep{}, so it is unlikely variation in SoS and EoS are perfectly correlated. This is reinforced by the observations that calendar growing seasons have indeed gotten longer with climate change \citep{}. 

%emw2024Sep19 -- Now you have set up the problem so I would then move more QUICKLY to the end of the intro (using some of your text below from the paragraph that starts 'These dynamics suggest that the carbon gain from an extended growing season') and making sure you set up the primary questions for the reader: Does season length connect to SOS (do EOS and SOS correlate)? Why don't we know? Well, we often use satellite data where all species blur together, but the fundamental process should start at the individual level and scale up from through to species and then forests ...  While the constraint should happen at the individual level, we rarely if ever have good EOS, that is -- observations that are of when plants stop growing versus when coloration changes (a known crappy measure, cite). At the next level, as EOS is locally adapted -- plants at different latitudes use unique photoperiods, combined with temperature, to time EOS, this means data across space contains a mix of factors [not sure about this sentence, but wanted to sneak in something like this].  You could re-write what you have below as ...

%emw2024Sep19 -- I think you're sort of giving away the punchline here. I think this makes your findings a bit duller to me ... I would move Fig 1 as the conceptual ending figure, and the next two paragraphs can move down also. This has the added benefit of making the intro shorter and shorter intros are good IMHO. 

%dl2024Sept20: agreed, the below paragraphs feel more like results. The two species examples also made me question the title, "...among species" as it makes it seem like we are testing for tends more within species.
But conditions that are suitable for photosynthesis are not uniform across the year (Figure 1a). While earlier leafout may increase the length of the calendar growing season, such shifts may have little effect on the thermal growing season, defined here as....\citep{} because the early spring isn't favorable. The thermal growth season is likely a better proxy for carbon gain. Even with very weak carry-over effects between SoS and EoS, phenological advances that drive SoS into less favorable conditions for carbon assimilation in the early spring, trade more carbon gain in mid season for reduced gain in early. 
%emw2024Sep19 -- also, I am not sure about the term 'phenological carryover' effect (what is a carry-over versus a correlation?) -- you might have to sell it to me over a zoom call or such....
%dl2024Sept20 I also made this note, I was not sure what "carryover referred to
%dl2024Sept20: I don't think you need to say "four individual plants" it made me initially think we only had data from four plants for those species.
We can see these dynamics play out by tracking the phenology of four individuals plants and an example. The earlier individual of \emph{Aronia melanocarpa} depicted in Figure \ref{fig:concept}a, starts growing 24 days before a later individual, but only ceases 13 days before it (i.e., it has a 14 day longer calendar growing season). However, because the 24 day growth advantage it has occurs when thermal conditions are less favorable, it ends up having a shorter thermal growing season (i.e., less change for carbon assimilation) than its later conspecific (Figure \ref{fig:concept}b). This is not the case for the later leafing species \emph{Myrica gale} where the both the earlier and later leafing individual start growing under more optimal thermal conditions, so the 20 day ``head start" the earlier individual incurs results in a both a longer calendar and thermal growing season (Figure \ref{fig:concept}a,c). 

These dynamics suggest that the carbon gain from an extended growing season, depends not only on the magnitude of phenological shifts but also the timing of those shifts relative to thermal conditions of the vegetative period, which not only vary across time and space, but also across the species that comprise forest communities. Understanding all this (say better) requires  understanding how the relationship between SoS and both thermal and calendar growing season varies depending on the unique phenological positions the species that make up a community. However, this is super difficult to do because...a few reason including...  

In this study, we use phenological observations from a multi-species common garden study to 
assess how variation in leafout and  budset phenology among species, years and populations affects the length of the calendar and thermal growing season. Specifically we ask:

\begin{enumerate} %emw2024Sep19 -- these seem like good questions to me, we could tighten up how clearly we answer them ... but it would help to know first if we will combine results and discussion?
%dl2024Sept20 A minor point, but maybe reorder these, two and three seem like our main questions. 
\item How strong is the carry-over effect between leafout and budset? 
\item Which phase more strongly influence variation in growing season length across years, species and populations?
\item How does variation in the leafout affect the length of the thermal and calendar growing season?
\end{enumerate}

This study offers insights into physiology that will allow us to scale from ecosystem level observations to individual mechanisms too, and improve forecasting. %emw2024Sep19 -- woo, woo. 

\section{Methods}
\subsubsection{The common garden at Weld Hill}
In 2014-2015, we collected seeds of 18 species woody plants from four field sites in eastern Northern America spanning a Y degree latitudinal gradient. The four field sites included Harvard Forest (42.55$^{\circ}$N, 72.20$^{\circ}$W), the White mountains (44.11$^{\circ}$N, 52.14$^{\circ}$W), Second College Grant of Dartmouth College (44.79$^{\circ}$N, 50.66$^{\circ}$W), and St. Hippolyte, CN (45.98$^{\circ}$N, 74.01$^{\circ}$W). We transported all seed back the the Weld Hill Research Building at the Arnold Arboretum in Boston MA (lat long) where we germinated seeds following standard germination protocols, and grew them to seedling stages for a year or so in the research green house. In Spring of 2017 we planted them out to establish the common garden at Weld hill. Plantings were randomized between 16 plot blocks. Individuals that were too small to survive outside were maintained in the growth facilities for an additional year and out planted in the early spring of 2018 (i think - yeah that's right!). Plots were divided between tree plots which included species x,y,z and shrub plots which included species a,b,c,d and shade cloth (Table \ref{listSp}). Plots were regularly weeded and watered throughout the duration of the study.
%dl2024Sept20 Added lat longs and started a table for the spp, seems better than listing in text IMO

\subsubsection{Phenological monitoring:}
For the years of 2018-2019, we made phenological observations of all individuals in the common garden twice per week from February to December. In 2020 due to the COVID 19 pandemic we did it a bit less, but Cat can say how much.
%cjc2024Sept25: Oh goodness!! It was 1-2x weekly I believe and seems to be confirmed when I look at the spreadsheet. 
We describe phenological stages using a modified bbch scale \citep{} a common metrics for quantify woody plant phenological progression. We observed all major vegetative stages (budburst, bbch 07, leafout bbch 15, end of leaf expansion bbch 19, budset bbch X, and leaf coloration/drop bbch z, and reproductive phases flowering (60-65) and fruiting and fruit drop(). 

\subsubsection{Data analysis}
To better understand the role that variation in leafout and budset phenology play in determining calendar growing season length among species populations and years we fit a Bayesian hierarchical with a Gaussian probability distribution. We calculated growing season duration by subtracting the day of leafout from the day of budset. We fit an intercept only model with phenophase timing (leafout, budset or growing season duration) as the response variable and partial pooling across species, populations and years. We only included observations with both budset and leafout observed on the same plant in this analysis ($n$= 595).

To assess the relationship between variation in leafout timing and calendar and thermal growing seasons we fit two additional regression models with thermal or calendar growing season length as the response variable and day of leafout as the main prediction. To account for species-level differences we included partially pooling on the slope and intercept of species.

We define the thermal growing season as the cumulative growing degree day heat sums between the day of leafout and the day of budset for each species. We calculated daily heat sums using the R package pollen \citep{} using a 10 $\degree$C base temperature with minimum and maximum daily temperature data from the weld hill weather station.

All models were fit in the R package brms on 4 chains with a 4000 iteration warm-up and 1000 sampling iterations on each chain for a total of 4,000 sampling iterations across all chains. We evaluated model fit, with no divergent transitions, rhats less than 1.01 and high effective sample sizes. All analysis were done in R.

\section{Results} %emw2024Sep19 -- I liked your questions, I might group answering them in the results (and since people are confused about variance -- keep all that in ONE paragraph and simplify and clarify the answers to your questions ... this would be way easier with a combined results and discussion). 
%dl2024Sept20 I agree, if our question is which phase has the stronger influence then discussing them together might help make this comparison
\subsubsection{Sources of variation in calendar growing season}
There was high variance in leafout timing among species and years ($\sigma_{species}$: 8.23 $UI_{95}$[5.22,12.81], $\sigma_{year}$:10.49 $UI_{95}$[4.27,24.60], Figure \ref{fig:vapar}a,b). Population level variation was low ($\sigma_{population}$:0.62, $UI_{95}$[0.02,2.82], Figure \ref{fig:vapar}c). \emph{Sambucus racemosa} was typically the first species to leafout in the spring, leafing out approximately two weeks before \emph{Sorbus americana} the last species to leaf out (Figure \ref{fig:vapar}c). There were no differences in leafout timing among the four populations included in our study (Figure \ref{fig:vapar}c). Leafout was the earliest in 2019 and the latest in 2020 (Figure \ref{fig:vapar}c). 

Relative to leafout, variance in budset timing was higher for species, years and populations ($\sigma_{species}$: 9.81 $UI_{95}$[ 6.61,14.49], $\sigma_{year}$: 14.92 $UI_{95}$[5.68,9.21], $\sigma_{population}$: 2.35, $UI_{95}$[0.23,8.51], Figure \ref{fig:vapar}), but followed similar relative contributions (highest variance in year, lowest in population).
Budset was earliest for \emph{Amelanchier canadensis} and latest for \emph{Alnus incana} and \emph{Betula paperifera} with more than three weeks between them (Figure \ref{fig:vapar}a). Populations from the Second College Grant set buds approximately three days before those from the white mountains, but these differences statistically weak (Figure \ref{fig:vapar}b). Like leafout 2019 had the earliest budset and 2020 the latest (Figure \ref{fig:vapar}b).

Variance in growing season length was highest among species ($\sigma_{species}$: 14.38, $UI_{95}$[9.85,20.81] and lower among years ($\sigma_{year}$: 4.67 $UI_{95}$[0.76,8.63], Figure \ref{fig:vapar}b) and populations ($\sigma_{population}$: 2.50, $UI_{95}$[0.19,2.82], Figure \ref{fig:vapar}c). Due to it's early leafout and late budset \emph{S.racemosa} had the longest calendar growing season of the species in our study. \emph{A. canadensis} and \emph{S. americana} had the shortest growing seasons, though for \emph{A. canadensis} this was due to early budset and for \emph{S. americana} late leafout (Figure \ref{fig:vapar}a). Population level differences in calendar growing season were determined by differences in budset, and followed the same pattern with Grant marginally earliest and white mountains  latest, with high uncertainty. (Figure \ref{fig:vapar}b). Despite substantial difference among years for leafout and budset, the calender growing season remained consistent over the three year study period (Figure \ref{fig:vapar}c).

The lower levels of variance among year in growing season length we observed relative to the high variance in both leafout and budset indicate that variation in the SoS and EoS among years is positively associated (ie early leafout= earlier budset), which is supported by weak but positive pearsons correlation coefficient of 0.32 $CI_{95}$[0.25, 0.39] we found between leafout and budset in our study.

\subsubsection{Relationship between leafout phenology and calender and thermal growing seasons}

We found that later leafout resulted in a shorter calendar growing season (Figure \ref{fig:thermcal}a) and that this relationship was consistent across species, though varying strength  (Figure \ref{fig:thermcal}b).
%dl2024Sept20 I could see some readers struggling here: there is a stronger effect in earlier spp for individuals that leafout later---stronger meaning what exactly? That the latest individuals of early species have the longest thermal growing seasons? I think it is explained well in the figure caption, but maybe needs more elaboration in the text.
In contrast, we found that a generally later leafout resulted in a longer thermal growing season (Figure \ref{fig:thermcal}c) in our study. This effect was stronger for species that typically leaf out earlier in the spring relative to others like \emph{Sambucus racemosa}, \emph{Viburnum cassiodes}, \emph{Spirea alba}, \emph{Diervella lonicera}, \emph{Aronia melanocarpa} \emph{Spirea tomentosa} and \emph{Betula populifolia} and was weaker in later species like \emph{Betula papyrifera}, \emph{Betula allegheniensis} and \emph{Alnus incana}(Figure \ref{fig:thermcal}d).
%cjc2024Sept25: I feel curious about upper temperature thresholds and what may be considered "too hot" for some species' productivity. Based on anecdotal evidence from Tree Spotters and these common garden observations, I remember some individuals dropping leaves in late summer before bud set because of drought-like conditions. I don't know if we can always assume that higher temperatures necessarily correlate to higher productivity - I'm thinking about assimilation curves and how they hit a peak at certain temperatures but begin to drop again with higher temps. 


\section{Discussion}
%emw2024Sep19 -- I find these results so cool that I think you should open broader and bigger and then get into the species differences .. so open with something like 'We found a fundamental and unexpected trade-off between early, longer growing seasons and the thermal growing season." Or something like that ... then talk about how unexpected this is and what it means, then get into the species-level differences in the next paragraph. 
Our multi-species common garden study showed that for already early leafing species, earlier leafout does not extend their thermal growing season---a proxy for potential carbon uptake period---despite extending the calendar growing season. In fact, we found that for these early leafing taxa, delayed leafout resulted in a longer thermal growing season. This relationship was in part explained by phenological carry-over between leafout and budset where later leafing individuals also set buds later, extending their growth into that later part of the season when thermal conditions were more favorable.  For later leafing species, earlier leafout did not substantially reduce their thermal growing season. This is likely because for them, even an earlier relative leafout still occurred in thermally favorable times of the season, and a relatively small advance in calendar time resulting in a proportionately large gain in thermal sums.

The dynamics may help to explain why phenology advances with climate change have not clearly translated into higher levels of primary productive \citep{}. Our results show that there is little advantage from a carbon or primary productive perspective for leafing out too early in the season, as thermal conditions are not favorable for photosynthesis and assimilation. Many of the species that are most phenologically sensitive to climate change are already among the earliest species to leaf out in temperate plant communities \citep{}, implying there may be little to gain from a carbon perspective.
%cjc2024Sept25: I love this above paragraph!! It's a thoughtful hypothesis that could explain so much. 

%emw2024Sep19 -- This seems a necessary paragraph but I would shorten the part about assembly to 1-2 sentences and make the paragraph more about BIOTIC consequences in general (these are generally ignored by many earth system models) by adding a sentence about the possibility of increase disease or pest damage with longer seasons.
%emw2024Sep19 -- another hypothesis from my colleagues in Europe is that this is a NEW problem and maybe before early species were more like late species and early WAS still good. I think that might be worth mentioning. 
%dl2024Sept20 We could sneak something about other traits here and set things up for a follow up paper on the traits we collected---maybe something to discuss further
So then why are species early? How is it then that phenologically trackers are doing better? \citep{}. In our study we only evaluated the thermal conditions that may affect photosynthesis, rather than photosynthesis itself, which also depends strongly on light availability which in forest systems is highly dependent on biotic interactions. In our study, the species that leafed out the earliest are under story shrubs, for whom access to light becomes severely limited later in the growing season as canopy trees leaf out. It may be that for these species, the light availability early in the season necessitates leafing out in thermally bad conditions. In fact, some studies suggest that under story shrubs get all/most of their carbon before canopy closure \citep{}.

%emw2024Sep19 -- yes, it's definitely still true that spring phenology in trees shifts much more than autumn ... you can probably check is the recent ipcc AR5 says it or the Menzel paper from a couple years ago. 
The phenological carry-over effects between leafout and budset that we observed was interesting in light of the fact that spring phenological phases are reported to be more plastic than autumn ones (is this still true?). Some of this might have to do with scale of measurement---macro-scale measurements like remote sensing may detect different things. Budset is the end of primary growth which we observed closely   
%dl2024Sept20 I felt this was not setup in the intro---did we expect to find population diff and if so why? 
The low levels of phenological variance between populations in our common garden provide little evidence for local adaptation in phenology. We found slightly stronger evidence for budset than leafout, which is consistent with the literature \citep{}. 

 This study shows linking phenological growing season to primary productivity requires account for phenological variation at multiple scales (individual, species level, multiple phases). Some forward thinking implications paragraph here.

%dl2024Sept20 One thought I had that I think would fit in the discussion: how does this relate to the distribution of a phenological event? What are the implications of species for which most individual are uniformly shifting vs a distribution of individuals with a left skew?

\section{Figures} %emw2024Sep19 -- I really like the figures! But I think if you put the first one last you can introduce as a fundamentally new and important view of early seasons as calendar days versus thermal days that wraps up the whole paper. I might then make the last figure first -- big take-home shocking message given first in figures and text! Then break down the variance and data in the other figure. 
%dl2024Sept20 can we add a legend defining the light and dark colors? I think the dark and light colors are switched in c.
%dl2024Sept20 I really like a, and what we are trying to show in b and c, but could see how the scale of the x-axis lessens the point we are trying to make.  Could we add some sort of transparent polygon in the background to show the thermal growing season and illustrate that the growth is outside of this window in b but not in c?

Panel a) depicts the daily heat sums at the Weld Hill Research Building in 2019 and the calendar growth season of early and late leafing individuals of \emph{Aronia melanocarpa} (green bars) and \emph{Myrica gale}(blue bars). Despite the fact the the early individual of \emph{A. melanocarpa} leafs out 24 days before it's later con-generic and only sets bud 13 days before it (i.e., it has a 14 day longer calendar growing season) it's thermal growing season is shorter (panel b) because most of its growth advantage (explain this better) takes place in the unfavorable early spring. In contrast for \emph{M. gale} where both the early and late individual leaf out later in the spring, the 20 day head start and 5 day earlier finish of the earlier individual (15 day longer calendar growing season) results in a longer thermal growing season for it as well (panel c)}.

%dl2024Sept20 would we want to add color to these plots to add more context: eg. a. color by tree/shrubs b. color gradient for latitudes or order them from high to low latitude, c. to me it would be more intuitive to have 2018 at the top
%dl2024Sept20 may want to also add bars for 90\% UI
%cjc2024Sept25: one thing that stands out for me in this figure is how similar the budset trends are to growing season lengths - maybe we want to highlight this a bit more in the results/discussion.
