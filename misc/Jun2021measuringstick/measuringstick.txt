On 1 June 2021 Cat and I used a GEOLENI Aluminum Grade Rod - 10ths, With Carrying Case and Rod level (16 Foot) to measure tree heights in the common garden.

The stick extends upwards and you see the measurement at about eye level. 

measuringstick5ft.jpg shows what we would measure as 5 feet 2 inches (see where the scissors and sharpie point).
measuringstick7ft.jpg shows what we would measure as 7 feet 2.5 inches (see where the scissors and sharpie point).

I was worried there was some noise around when you pull out a new part of the rod (e.g., see measuringstick7ft.jpg and you see 2 spots that could be 7 feet 2 inches, but it seemed when I measured it with a metric tape to be only maybe 0.5-1 cm of an issue)

The feet are measured in feet and TEN INCH units. As best I can tell they do NOT convert to regular feet and inches .... but here are some conversions I calculated quickly using a measuring tape (original in my pink notebook):

On aluminum (main side we used):
4 feet			1.14 m
5 feet 6 inches		1.61 m 
7 feet			2.2 m
7 feet 2 inches		2.07 m	
7 feet 3 inches		2.11 m

On white/black/red side:
2 feet			52 cm
3 feet			82 cm
