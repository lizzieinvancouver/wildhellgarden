	abstract = {Variation in plant functional traits results from evolutionary and environmental drivers that operate at a variety of different scales, which makes it a challenge to differentiate among them. In this article we describe patterns of functional trait variation and trait correlations within and among habitats in relation to several environmental and trade-off axes. We then ask whether such patterns reflect natural selection and can be considered plant strategies. In so doing we highlight evidence that demonstrates that (1) patterns of trait variation across resource and environmental gradients (light, water, nutrients, and temperature) probably reflect adaptation, (2) plant trait variation typically involves multiple-correlated traits that arise because of inevitable trade-offs among traits and across levels of whole-plant integration and that must be understood from a whole-plant perspective, and (3) such adaptation may be globally generalizable for like conditions; i. e., the set of traits (collections of traits in syndromes) of taxa can be considered as "plant strategies."},

Here, we show that in hybrid poplar, the critical day length for growth cessation and the duration of bud formation each vary with local climatic conditions in identical genotypes. The detailed dissection of bud set suggests temperature as one additional environmental factor that modifies the sensitivity to day-length signals at growth cessation and influences the duration of bud formation in poplar. The ability of perennial plants to integrate additional environmental signals with photoperiod signaling may add to short-term acclimatization to the predicted longer growing seasons in future climates.},

	abstract = {Autumn senescence in mature aspens, grown under natural conditions, is initiated at almost the same date every year. The mechanism of such precise timing is not understood but we have previously shown that the signal must be derived from light. We studied variation in bud set and autumn senescence in a collection of 116 natural Eurasian aspen (Populus tremula) genotypes, from 12 populations in Sweden and planted in one northern and one southern common garden, to test the hypothesis that onset of autumn senescence is triggered by day length. We confirmed that, although bud set seemed to be triggered by a critical photoperiod/day length, other factors may influence it. The data on initiation of autumn senescence, on the other hand, were incompatible with the trigger being the day length per se, hence the trigger must be some other light-dependent factor.},

@article{Olsen2014,
	abstract = {<p>Young seedlings of the conifer Norway spruce exhibit short day (SD)-induced cessation of apical growth and bud set. Although different, constant temperatures under SD are known to modulate timing of bud set and depth of dormancy with development of deeper dormancy under higher compared to lower temperature, systematic studies of effects of alternating day (DT) and night temperatures (NT) are limited. To shed light on this, seedlings of different provenances of Norway spruce were exposed to a wide range of DT-NT combinations during bud development, followed by transfer to forcing conditions of long days (LD) and 18$\,^{\circ}$C, directly or after different periods of chilling. Although no specific effect of alternating DT/NT was found, the results demonstrate that the effects of DT under SD on bud set and subsequent bud break are significantly modified by NT in a complex way. The effects on bud break persisted after chilling. Since time to bud set correlated with the daily mean temperature under SD at DTs of 18 and 21$\,^{\circ}$C, but not a DT of 15$\,^{\circ}$C, time to bud set apparently also depend on the specific DT, implying that the effect of NT depends on the actual DT. Although higher temperature under SD generally results in later bud break after transfer to forcing conditions, the fastest bud flush was observed at intermediate NTs. This might be due to a bud break-hastening chilling effect of intermediate compared to higher temperatures, and delayed bud development to a stage where bud burst can occur, under lower temperatures. Also, time to bud burst in un-chilled seedlings decreased with increasing SD-duration, suggesting that bud development must reach a certain stage before the processes leading to bud burst are initiated. The present results also indicate that low temperature during bud development had a larger effect on the most southern compared to the most northern provenance studied. Decreasing time to bud burst was observed with increasing northern latitude of origin in un-chilled as well as chilled plants. In conclusion, being a highly temperature-dependent process, bud development is strongly delayed by low temperature, and the effects of DT is significantly modified by NT in a complex manner.</p>},

@article{Vander2016,
	abstract = {Natural populations of woody species are adapted to local growth conditions. Non-local provenances may sense the difference between the local environment and the site conditions at their origin. To study the impact of provenance selection of planting stock in (re)forestation and landscape plantings, the variation in the adaptive traits bud burst, bud set, flower opening, leaf morphology and height increment was examined within and between local and non-local provenances of Prunus spinosa in a provenance trial, located in Flanders (northern part of Belgium), during two consecutive years (shrubs were three and four years old) which contrasted strongly in spring temperatures. Five Flemish provenances were included together with three commercially available provenances originating from Wallonia (southern part of Belgium), Hungary and Spain. When comparing the two observational years, the Spanish provenance showed a plastic temporal response in bud burst, while the Hungarian provenance and to a lesser extent the Walloon provenance responded plastically in bud set. The Hungarian provenance flushed first in 2013 but was not the first to flush in 2014, whereas in 2014 flowers opened first. The rank order among the provenances in flushing was not maintained in flower opening although both phenophases occur congruently. Wide-leaved shrubs tended to flush and flower slightly earlier and to grow slightly quicker compared to narrow-leaved shrubs, possibly as a result of historical hybridisation processes. Height increment did not vary significantly between the Flemish and commercial provenances, except the Hungarian provenance, which showed a slightly retarded youth growth. The different responses between local and non-local provenances may indicate maladaptation of the latter.
Zusammenfassung
Nat{\"u}rliche Populationen von Geh{\"o}lzarten sind an die lokalen Wachstumsbedingungen adaptiert. Nicht-lokale Herk{\"u}nfte k{\"o}nnten einen Unterschied zwischen der lokalen Umwelt und den Standortsbedingungen in ihrer Ursprungsregion erfahren. Um den Einfluss der Auswahl der Herk{\"u}nfte von Pflanzmaterial f{\"u}r (Wieder-)Aufforstungen und Landschaftsbegr{\"u}nung zu untersuchen, erfassten wir die Variation der adaptiven Merkmale Aufspringen der Knospen, Knospenansatz, {\"O}ffnen der Bl{\"u}ten, Blattmorphologie und H{\"o}henwachstum bei lokalen und ausw{\"a}rtigen Herk{\"u}nften von Prunus spinosa. Wir nutzen eine Versuchsfl{\"a}che in Flandern (n{\"o}rdliches Belgien) in zwei aufeinander folgenden Jahren, die sich stark hinsichtlich der Fr{\"u}hjahrstemperaturen unterschioeden (Alter der Str{\"a}ucher: drei bzw. vier Jahre). F{\"u}nf fl{\"a}mische Herk{\"u}nfte wurden untersucht sowie drei kommerziell erh{\"a}ltliche Herk{\"u}nfte aus Wallonien (s{\"u}dliches Belgien), Ungarn und Spanien. Beim Vergleich der beiden Jahre zeigte die spanische Herkunft eine plastische zeitliche Reaktion beim Knospensprung, w{\"a}hrend die ungarische Herkunft und in geringerem Ma{\ss}e die wallonische Herkunft plastisch beim Knospenansatz reagierten. Die Ungarische Herkunft trieb 2013 als erste aus, war aber 2014 nicht die fr{\"u}heste Herkunft, w{\"a}hrend sie 2014 als erste die Bl{\"u}ten {\"o}ffnete. Die Reihenfolge der Herk{\"u}nfte beim Austreiben wurde nicht beim {\"O}ffnen der Bl{\"u}ten beibehalten. Breitbl{\"a}ttrige Str{\"a}ucher tendierten dazu, etwas fr{\"u}her auszutreiben, zu bl{\"u}hen und etwas schneller zu wachsen als schmalbl{\"a}ttrige Str{\"a}ucher, was m{\"o}glicherweise auf historische Hybridisierungen zur{\"u}ckzuf{\"u}hren ist. Die Gr{\"o}{\ss}enzunahme unterschied sich nicht signifikant zwischen den fl{\"a}mischen und den kommerziellen Herk{\"u}nften. Nur die ungarische Herkunft zeigte ein leicht verz{\"o}gertes Jugendwachstum. Die unterschiedlichen Reaktionen der lokalen und ausw{\"a}rtigen Herk{\"u}nfte k{\"o}nnten eine Fehlanpassung der letztgenannten anzeigen.},

	abstract = {Summary Populus trichocarpa is widespread across western North America spanning extensive variation in photoperiod, growing season and climate. We investigated trait variation in P. trichocarpa using over 2000 trees from a common garden at Vancouver, Canada, representing replicate plantings of 461 genotypes originating from 136 provenance localities. We measured 40 traits encompassing phenological events, biomass accumulation, growth rates, and leaf, isotope and gas exchange-based ecophysiology traits. With replicated plantings and 29 354 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 3518 genes, we estimated both broad-sense trait heritability (H2) and overall population genetic structure from principal component analysis. Populus trichocarpa had high phenotypic variation and moderate/high H2 for many traits. H2 ranged from 0.3 to 0.9 in phenology, 0.3 to 0.8 in biomass and 0.1 to 0.8 in ecophysiology traits. Most traits correlated strongly with latitude, maximum daylength and temperature of tree origin, but not necessarily with elevation, precipitation or heat : moisture indices. Trait H2 values reflected trait correlation strength with geoclimate variables. The population genetic structure had one significant principal component (PC1) which correlated with daylength and showed enrichment for genes relating to circadian rhythm and photoperiod. Robust relationships between traits, population structure and geoclimate in P. trichocarpa reflect patterns which suggest that range-wide geographical and environment gradients have shaped its genotypic and phenotypic variability.},

@article{vico2021,
	abstract = {In Northern Europe, poplars (Populus) can provide biomass for energy and material use, but most available clones were developed for lower latitudes and are unlikely to be well adapted to higher latitudes, even under warmer climates. We thus need to understand how clones respond to climatic conditions and photoperiod, and how these responses can be predicted. We answer these questions exploiting leaf phenological data of Populus clones, grown in six sites across the Baltic region, in Northern Europe, for 2 years with contrasting climatic conditions. Regarding the effects of climatic conditions and photoperiod, within each site, higher temperatures advanced the timing and enhanced the speed of spring and autumn phenology, but reduced the effective growing season length. Across sites, latitude affected the timing of spring and autumn phenology, the speed of spring phenology, and the effective growing season length; clone affected only the timing of phenology. Regarding the predictability of clone response to growing conditions, the growing degree day (GDD) model could not predict spring phenology, because the growing degree day threshold for a specific phenological stage was not only clone-, but also latitude- and year-specific. Yet, this GDD threshold allowed a robust ranking of clones across sites and years, thus providing a tool to determine the relative differences across clones, independently of latitude and temperature. A similar, but not as strong, pattern was observed in the timing of spring and autumn phenological stages. Hence, while prediction of spring phenology remains elusive, the ranking of clones based on observations of their phenology in a single location can provide useful indications on the clones'relative performance under different latitudes and climates.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Aim To quantify the intra-community variability of leaf-out (ICVLo) among dominant trees in temperate deciduous forests, assess its links with specific and phylogenetic diversity, identify its environmental drivers and deduce its ecological consequences with regard to radiation received and exposure to late frost. Location Eastern North America (ENA) and Europe (EUR). Time Period 2009--2022. Major Taxa Studied Temperate deciduous forest trees. Methods We developed an approach to quantify ICVLo through the analysis of RGB images taken from phenological cameras. We related ICVLo to species richness, phylogenetic diversity and environmental conditions. We quantified the intra-community variability of the amount of radiation received and of exposure to late frost. Results Leaf-out occurred over a longer time interval in ENA than in EUR. The sensitivity of leaf-out to temperature was identical in both regions (−3.4 days per $\,^{\circ}$C). The distributions of ICVLo were similar in EUR and ENA forests, despite the latter being more species-rich and phylogenetically diverse. In both regions, cooler conditions and an earlier occurrence of leaf-out resulted in higher ICVLo. ICVLo resulted in ca. 8\% difference of radiation received from leaf-out to September among individual trees. Forest communities in ENA had shorter safety margins as regards the exposure to late frosts, and were actually more frequently exposed to late frosts. Main Conclusions We conducted the first intercontinental analysis of the variability of leaf-out at the scale of tree communities. North American and European forests showed similar ICVLo, in spite of their differences in terms of species richness and phylogenetic diversity, highlighting the relevance of environmental controls on ICVLo. We quantified two ecological implications of ICVLo (difference in terms of radiation received and exposure to late frost), which should be explored in the context of ongoing climate change, which affects trees differently according to their phenological niche.},

	abstract = {Summary Leafing-out of woody plants begins the growing season in temperate forests and is one of the most important drivers of ecosystem processes. There is substantial variation in the timing of leaf-out, both within and among species, but the leaf development of almost all temperate tree and shrub species is highly sensitive to temperature. As a result, leaf-out times of temperate forests are valuable for observing the effects of climate change. Analysis of phenology data from around the world indicates that leaf-out is generally earlier in warmer years than in cooler years and that the onset of leaf-out has advanced in many locations. Changes in the timing of leaf-out will affect carbon sequestration, plant--animal interactions, and other essential ecosystem processes. The development of remote sensing methods has expanded the scope of leaf-out monitoring from the level of an individual plant or forest to an entire region. Meanwhile, historical data have informed modeling and experimental studies addressing questions about leaf-out timing. For most species, onset of leaf-out will continue to advance, although advancement may be slowed for some species because of unmet chilling requirements. More information is needed to reduce the uncertainty in predicting the timing of future spring onset. Contents Summary 926 I. Introduction 927 II. What triggers a plant to leaf-out? 928 III.

@article{donnelly2017,
	abstract = {A wide range of intra- and interspecific variation occurs in spring leaf phenology as a result of biotic factors such as, life strategy, ecological niche and genetic adaptation, and abiotic factors such as environmental condition. Whereas knowing when the start of bud-burst occurs is necessary for determining the beginning of the growing season, and the subsequent start of carbon uptake, the duration of phenophases is equally important (to estimate the rate of carbon uptake, for example), but rarely reported. Here, we investigate variation in the timing and duration of 3 key phenophase categories (bud-open, leaf-out, full-leaf unfolded) from a range of 8 broadleaf and 2 conifer species in a mixed forest in northern Wisconsin, USA over a 5-year period. As expected, the start of each phenophase category varied across species and years and an earlier start to one phenophase did not necessarily result in an earlier start to subsequent phenophases nor did it mean a faster or slower progression. Ecological niche was not always a useful predictor of the timing or duration of the spring phenology season. The spring phenology season from bud-burst to full leaf open for the entire forest community took an average of 13days ranging from 12 to 18days across species. Bud-open and leaf-out lasted an average of 4days whereas, full-leaf unfolding lasted 5 and again there were variations among species. Full leaf unfolded for A. incana lasted significantly (p<0.001) longer than other species. Variation in the duration of the spring phenology season among years closely tracked local seasonal air-temperature based on growing degree hours (GDH). These results could be used to help determine the relationship between phenology and the potential for carbon storage in early spring in a mixed forest and highlight the value of direct field observation data at species level, the detail of which cannot, at present, be captured by satellite remote sensing.},

@article{ma2022,
	abstract = {Abstract Vegetation phenology has been viewed as the nature's calendar and an integrative indicator of plant-climate interactions. The correct representation of vegetation phenology is important for models to accurately simulate the exchange of carbon, water, and energy between the vegetated land surface and the atmosphere. Remote sensing has advanced the monitoring of vegetation phenology by providing spatially and temporally continuous data that together with conventional ground observations offers a unique contribution to our knowledge about the environmental impact on ecosystems as well as the ecological adaptations and feedback to global climate change. Land surface phenology (LSP) is defined as the use of satellites to monitor seasonal dynamics in vegetated land surfaces and to estimate phenological transition dates. LSP, as an interdisciplinary subject among remote sensing, ecology, and biometeorology, has undergone rapid development over the past few decades. Recent advances in sensor technologies, as well as data fusion techniques, have enabled novel phenology retrieval algorithms that refine phenology details at even higher spatiotemporal resolutions, providing new insights into ecosystem dynamics. As such, here we summarize the recent advances in LSP and the associated opportunities for science applications. We focus on the remaining challenges, promising techniques, and emerging topics that together we believe will truly form the very frontier of the global LSP research field.},

	abstract = {Natural climate solutions are critical actions of ecosystem stewardship to mitigate climate change. However, prioritizing locations and possible actions is challenging. We demonstrate a generalizable approach for identifying potential opportunities for natural climate solutions by creating a spatial hierarchy of land management restrictions. Global forest carbon stocks and flux models were then used to explore forest-based natural climate solutions in the high-carbon density coastal temperate rainforests of western North America. Our results show 13 million hectares are available for action, an area that holds 4,900 $\pm$640 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent and represents 45{\%} of regional and 0.5{\%} of global aboveground forest carbon stocks. Based on historical trends, a 10{\%} reduction in average annual forest carbon loss through improved forest management and conservation could reduce forest carbon emissions by 9.1 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year, corresponding to 5.2{\%} of the 2030 land-based climate commitments made by the United States and Canada. Large-scale implementation of natural climate solutions will require collaborative planning with forest-dependent communities, industry, governments, and Indigenous peoples.},

@article{roe2021,
	abstract = {Abstract Land-based climate mitigation measures have gained significant attention and importance in public and private sector climate policies. Building on previous studies, we refine and update the mitigation potentials for 20 land-based measures in >200 countries and five regions, comparing ``bottom-up'' sectoral estimates with integrated assessment models (IAMs). We also assess implementation feasibility at the country level. Cost-effective (available up to \$100/tCO2eq) land-based mitigation is 8--13.8 GtCO2eq yr−1 between 2020 and 2050, with the bottom end of this range representing the IAM median and the upper end representing the sectoral estimate. The cost-effective sectoral estimate is about 40\% of available technical potential and is in line with achieving a 1.5$\,^{\circ}$C pathway in 2050. Compared to technical potentials, cost-effective estimates represent a more realistic and actionable target for policy. The cost-effective potential is approximately 50\% from forests and other ecosystems, 35\% from agriculture, and 15\% from demand-side measures. The potential varies sixfold across the five regions assessed (0.75--4.8 GtCO2eq yr−1) and the top 15 countries account for about 60\% of the global potential. Protection of forests and other ecosystems and demand-side measures present particularly high mitigation efficiency, high provision of co-benefits, and relatively lower costs. The feasibility assessment suggests that governance, economic investment, and socio-cultural conditions influence the likelihood that land-based mitigation potentials are realized. A substantial portion of potential (80\%) is in developing countries and LDCs, where feasibility barriers are of greatest concern. Assisting countries to overcome barriers may result in significant quantities of near-term, low-cost mitigation while locally achieving important climate adaptation and development benefits. Opportunities among countries vary widely depending on types of land-based measures available, their potential co-benefits and risks, and their feasibility. Enhanced investments and country-specific plans that accommodate this complexity are urgently needed to realize the large global potential from improved land stewardship.},

Dunal., Aesculus glabra Willd., Acer saccharum Marsh., Lindera benzoin (L.) Blume and Carpinus caroliniana Walt. in a deciduous forest in Illinois, USA, spring avoidance with leaves at full size ranged from 0 days for Asimina to 24 days for Aesculus, and brought 36?98{\%} of estimated total annual irradiance. Autumn avoidance was non-existent to minimal in all species. 3 Total chlorophyll reached maximum concentrations at the middle of leaf life span, and declined well before senescence. Leaf nitrogen concentrations and net photosynthetic capacity both peaked in youngest leaves during spring avoidance, and were low in old leaves during autumn avoidance. 4 Aesculus had especially high photosynthetic capacity during precanopy closure, while Asimina had relatively low capacity in its later developing leaves. 5 Young leaves of species with phenological avoidance can enhance C gain, while old leaves in autumn do not. Thus phenological avoidance in spring may enhance the persistence of understorey woody individuals of some species.},

	abstract = {Abstract What is addressed as growing season in terrestrial ecosystems is one of the main determinants of annual plant biomass production globally. However, there is no well-defined concept behind. Here, we show different facets of what might be termed growing season, each with a distinct meaning: (1) the time period during which a plant or a part of it actually grows and produces new tissue, irrespective of net carbon gain (growing season sensu stricto). (2) The period defined by developmental, that is, phenological markers (phenological season). (3) The period during which vegetation as a whole achieves its annual net primary production (NPP) or a net ecosystem production (NEP), expressed as net carbon gain (productive season) and (4) the period during which plants could potentially grow based on meteorological criteria (meteorological season). We hypothesize that the duration of such a `window of opportunity' is a strong predictor for NPP at a global scale, especially for forests. These different definitions have implications for the understanding and modelling of plant growth and biomass production. The common view that variation in phenology is a proxy for variation in productivity is misleading, often resulting in unfounded statements on potential consequences of climatic warming such as carbon sequestration.},

@article{Zeng2024,
	abstract = {Summary Forecasting the biological impacts of climate change requires understanding how species respond to warmer temperatures through interannual flexible variation vs through adaptation to local conditions. Yet, we often lack this information entirely or find conflicting evidence across studies, which is the case for spring phenology. We synthesized common garden studies across Europe and North America that reported spring event dates for a mix of angiosperm and gymnosperm tree species in the northern hemisphere, capturing data from 384 North American and 101 European provenances (i.e. populations) with observations from 1962 to 2019, alongside autumn event data when provided. Across continents, we found no evidence of provenance effects in spring phenology, but strong clines with latitude and mean annual temperature in autumn. These effects, however, appeared to diverge by continent and species type (gymnosperm vs angiosperm), with particularly pronounced clines in North America in autumn events. Our results suggest flexible, likely plastic responses, in spring phenology with warming, and potential limits -- at least in the short term -- due to provenance effects for autumn phenology. They also highlight that, after over 250 yr of common garden studies on tree phenology, we still lack a holistic predictive model of clines across species and phenological events.},

Current forecasts, however, have failed to capture important variability in biological responses, especially across species. Here we present a new method using Bayesian hierarchical phylogenetic models and show that species-level differences are larger than the average differences between cues. Applying our method to phenological experiments manipulating temperature and day length we show an underlying phylogenetic structure in plant phenological responses to temperature cues, whereas responses to photoperiod appear weaker, more uniform across species and less phylogenetically constrained. We thus illustrate how a focus on certain clades can bias prediction, but that predictions may be improved by integrating information on phylogeny to better estimate species-level responses.

	abstract = {The timing, length, and thermal intensity of the climatic growing season in China show statistically significant changes over the period of 1955 to 2000. Nationally, the average start of the growing season has shifted 4.6--5.5 days earlier while the average end has moved 1.8--3.7 days later, increasing the length of the growing season by 6.9--8.7 days depending on the base temperature chosen. The thermal intensity of the growing season has increased by 74.9--196.8 growing degree-days, depending on the base temperature selected. The spatial characteristics of the change in the timing and length of the growing season differ from the geographical pattern of change in temperatures over this period; but the spatial characteristics of change in growing degree-days does resemble the pattern for temperatures, with higher rates in northern regions. Nationally, two distinct regimes are evident over time: an initial period where growing season indicators fluctuate near a base period average, and a second period of rapidly increasing growing season length and thermal intensity. Growing degree-days are highly correlated with March-to-November mean air temperatures in all climatic regions of China; the length of the growing season is likewise highly correlated with March-to-November mean air temperatures except in east, southeast and southwest China at base temperature of 0$\,^{\circ}$C and southeast China at base temperature of 5$\,^{\circ}$C. The growing season start date appears to have the greater influence on the length of the growing season. In China, warmer growing seasons are also likely to be longer growing seasons.},

	abstract = {Climate change is shifting the growing seasons of plants, affecting species performance and biogeochemical cycles. Yet how the timing of autumn leaf senescence in Northern Hemisphere forests will change remains uncertain. Using satellite, ground, carbon flux, and experimental data, we show that early-season and late-season warming have opposite effects on leaf senescence, with a reversal occurring after the year's longest day (the summer solstice). Across 84\% of the northern forest area, increased temperature and vegetation activity before the solstice led to an earlier senescence onset of, on average, 1.9 $\pm$ 0.1 days per $\,^{\circ}$C, whereas warmer post-solstice temperatures extended senescence duration by 2.6 $\pm$ 0.1 days per $\,^{\circ}$C. The current trajectories toward an earlier onset and slowed progression of senescence affect Northern Hemisphere--wide trends in growing-season length and forest productivity. Global warming is changing the timing of photosynthesis, with leaves emerging earlier in spring in the temperate and boreal zones. A longer growing season could mean greater carbon sequestration in forests, but the timing of leaves falling in autumn depends on multiple cues, making it difficult to predict. Zohner et al. investigated how leaf senescence relates to day length, temperature, and early-season photosynthesis across northern forests using remote sensing, ground observations, and experimental data. They found that warming had opposing effects on senescence dates depending on when it occurred: Warmer springs with higher photosynthesis correlated with earlier senescence, wheras warmer temperatures in autumn delayed senescence. Incorporating this shift in knowledge may improve predictions of vegetation response to climate change. ---BEL Early-season warming hastens onset and late-season warming extends duration of autumn leaf senescence in northern forests.},

Despite its importance, current understanding of the drivers of senescence is limited, leading to a large spread in predictions of how the timing of senescence, and thus the length of the growing season, will change under future climate conditions. The most commonly held paradigm is that temperature and photoperiod are the primary controls, which suggests a future extension of the autumnal growing season as global temperatures rise. Here, using two decades of ground- and satellite-based observations of temperate deciduous forest phenology, we show that the timing of autumn senescence is correlated with the timing of spring budburst across the entire eastern United States. On a year-to-year basis, an earlier/later spring was associated with an earlier/later autumn senescence, both for individual species and at a regional scale. We use the observed relationship to develop a novel model of autumn phenology. In contrast to current phenology models, this model predicts that the potential response of autumn phenology to future climate change is strongly limited by the impact of climate change on spring phenology. Current models of autumn phenology therefore may overpredict future increases in the length of the growing season, with subsequent impacts for modeling future CO2 uptake and evapotranspiration.},

In this study, we applied four methods to extract EOS dates from NDVI records between 1982 and 2011 for the Northern Hemisphere, and determined the temporal correlations between EOS and environmental factors (i.e., temperature, precipitation and insolation), as well as the correlation between spring and autumn phenology, using partial correlation analyses. Overall, we observed a trend toward later EOS in \~{}70{\%} of the pixels in Northern Hemisphere, with a mean rate of 0.18 $\pm$0.38 days yr?1. Warming preseason temperature was positively associated with the rate of EOS in most of our study area, except for arid/semi-arid regions, where the precipitation sum played a dominant positive role. Interestingly, increased preseason insolation sum might also lead to a later date of EOS. In addition to the climatic effects on EOS, we found an influence of spring vegetation green-up dates on EOS, albeit biome dependent. Our study, therefore, suggests that both environmental factors and spring phenology should be included in the modeling of EOS to improve the predictions of autumn phenology as well as our understanding of the global carbon and nutrient balances.},

	abstract = {The length of the growing season in temperate forests has been increasing under recent climate change because of earlier leaf emergence and later leaf senescence. However, Zani et al. show that this trend might be reversed as increasing photosynthetic productivity begins to drive earlier autumn leaf senescence (see the Perspective by Rollinson). Using a combination of experimental, observational, and modeling studies based on European forest trees, the researchers conclude that leaf senescence will advance by 3 to 6 days by the end of the 21st century rather than lengthening by 1 to 3 weeks as current phenological models have predicted. In turn, this predicted phenological pattern will limit the capacity of temperate forests to mitigate climate change through carbon uptake. Science, this issue p. 1066; see also p. 1030 Physiological constraints on the growing season and productivity may limit the capacity of temperate forests to retain carbon. Changes in the growing-season lengths of temperate trees greatly affect biotic interactions and global carbon balance. Yet future growing-season trajectories remain highly uncertain because the environmental drivers of autumn leaf senescence are poorly understood. Using experiments and long-term observations, we show that increases in spring and summer productivity due to elevated carbon dioxide, temperature, or light levels drive earlier senescence. Accounting for this effect improved the accuracy of senescence predictions by 27 to 42\% and reversed future predictions from a previously expected 2- to 3-week delay over the rest of the century to an advance of 3 to 6 days. These findings demonstrate the critical role of sink limitation in governing the end of seasonal activity and reveal important constraints on future growing-season lengths and carbon uptake of trees.},

	abstract = {Recent research suggests that increases in growing-season length (GSL) in mid-northern latitudes may be partially responsible for increased forest growth and carbon sequestration. We used the BIOME-BGC ecosystem model to investigate the impacts of including a dynamically regulated GSL on simulated carbon and water balance over a historical 88-year record (1900--1987) for 12 sites in the eastern USA deciduous broadleaf forest. For individual sites, the predicted GSL regularly varied by more than 15 days. When grouped into three climatic zones, GSL variability was still large and rapid. There is a recent trend in colder, northern sites toward a longer GSL, but not in moderate and warm climates. The results show that, for all sites, prediction of a long GSL versus using the mean GSL increased net ecosystem production (NEP), gross primary production (GPP), and evapotranspiration (ET); conversely a short GSL is predicted to decrease these parameters. On an absolute basis, differences in GPP between the dynamic and mean GSL simulations were larger than the differences in NEP. As a percentage difference, though, NEP was much more sensitive to changes in GSL than were either GPP or ET. On average, a 1-day change in GSL changed NEP by 1.6{\%}, GPP by 0.5{\%}, and ET by 0.2{\%}. Predictions of NEP and GPP in cold climates were more sensitive to changes in GSL than were predictions in warm climates. ET was not similarly sensitive. First, our results strongly agree with field measurements showing a high correlation between NEP and dates of spring growth, and second they suggest that persistent increases in GSL may lead to long-term increases in carbon storage.},

	abstract = {Abstract Using data from 28 flux measurement sites, we performed an analysis of the relationship between annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and the length of the carbon uptake period (CUP) (the number of days when the ecosystem is a net carbon sink). The observations suggest a linear correlation between the two quantities. The change in annual carbon exchange per day of the CUP differs significantly between deciduous and evergreen vegetation types. The sites containing vegetation with short-lived foliage (less than 1 year) have higher carbon uptake and respiration rates than evergreen vegetation. The ratio between mean daily carbon exchange rates during carbon uptake and release periods is relatively invariant (2.73$\pm$1.08) across different vegetation types. This implies that a balance between carbon release and uptake periods exists despite different photosynthetic pathways, life forms, and leaf habits. The mean daily carbon sequestration rate for these ecosystems never exceeds the carbon emission rate by more than a factor of 3. Growing season lengths for the study sites were derived from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of advanced very-high-resolution radiometer and from the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) of VEGETATION SPOT-4. NDVI and EVI were found to be closely related to the CUP, and consequently they also can be used to approximate annual carbon exchange of the ecosystems. This approach has potential for allowing extrapolation of NEE over large areas from remotely sensed data, given a certain amount of ancillary information. This method could complement the currently existing techniques for extrapolation, which rely upon modeling of the individual gross fluxes.},

@article{Zohner2023,
	abstract = {Climate change is shifting the growing seasons of plants, affecting species performance and biogeochemical cycles. Yet how the timing of autumn leaf senescence in Northern Hemisphere forests will change remains uncertain. Using satellite, ground, carbon flux, and experimental data, we show that early-season and late-season warming have opposite effects on leaf senescence, with a reversal occurring after the year's longest day (the summer solstice). Across 84\% of the northern forest area, increased temperature and vegetation activity before the solstice led to an earlier senescence onset of, on average, 1.9 $\pm$ 0.1 days per $\,^{\circ}$C, whereas warmer post-solstice temperatures extended senescence duration by 2.6 $\pm$ 0.1 days per $\,^{\circ}$C. The current trajectories toward an earlier onset and slowed progression of senescence affect Northern Hemisphere--wide trends in growing-season length and forest productivity. Global warming is changing the timing of photosynthesis, with leaves emerging earlier in spring in the temperate and boreal zones. A longer growing season could mean greater carbon sequestration in forests, but the timing of leaves falling in autumn depends on multiple cues, making it difficult to predict. Zohner et al. investigated how leaf senescence relates to day length, temperature, and early-season photosynthesis across northern forests using remote sensing, ground observations, and experimental data. They found that warming had opposing effects on senescence dates depending on when it occurred: Warmer springs with higher photosynthesis correlated with earlier senescence, wheras warmer temperatures in autumn delayed senescence. Incorporating this shift in knowledge may improve predictions of vegetation response to climate change. ---BEL Early-season warming hastens onset and late-season warming extends duration of autumn leaf senescence in northern forests.},

@article{Zani2020,
	abstract = {The length of the growing season in temperate forests has been increasing under recent climate change because of earlier leaf emergence and later leaf senescence. However, Zani et al. show that this trend might be reversed as increasing photosynthetic productivity begins to drive earlier autumn leaf senescence (see the Perspective by Rollinson). Using a combination of experimental, observational, and modeling studies based on European forest trees, the researchers conclude that leaf senescence will advance by 3 to 6 days by the end of the 21st century rather than lengthening by 1 to 3 weeks as current phenological models have predicted. In turn, this predicted phenological pattern will limit the capacity of temperate forests to mitigate climate change through carbon uptake. Science, this issue p. 1066; see also p. 1030 Physiological constraints on the growing season and productivity may limit the capacity of temperate forests to retain carbon. Changes in the growing-season lengths of temperate trees greatly affect biotic interactions and global carbon balance. Yet future growing-season trajectories remain highly uncertain because the environmental drivers of autumn leaf senescence are poorly understood. Using experiments and long-term observations, we show that increases in spring and summer productivity due to elevated carbon dioxide, temperature, or light levels drive earlier senescence. Accounting for this effect improved the accuracy of senescence predictions by 27 to 42\% and reversed future predictions from a previously expected 2- to 3-week delay over the rest of the century to an advance of 3 to 6 days. These findings demonstrate the critical role of sink limitation in governing the end of seasonal activity and reveal important constraints on future growing-season lengths and carbon uptake of trees.},
