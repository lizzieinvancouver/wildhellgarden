@article{Zohner2023,
	abstract = {Climate change is shifting the growing seasons of plants, affecting species performance and biogeochemical cycles. Yet how the timing of autumn leaf senescence in Northern Hemisphere forests will change remains uncertain. Using satellite, ground, carbon flux, and experimental data, we show that early-season and late-season warming have opposite effects on leaf senescence, with a reversal occurring after the year's longest day (the summer solstice). Across 84\% of the northern forest area, increased temperature and vegetation activity before the solstice led to an earlier senescence onset of, on average, 1.9 $\pm$ 0.1 days per $\,^{\circ}$C, whereas warmer post-solstice temperatures extended senescence duration by 2.6 $\pm$ 0.1 days per $\,^{\circ}$C. The current trajectories toward an earlier onset and slowed progression of senescence affect Northern Hemisphere--wide trends in growing-season length and forest productivity. Global warming is changing the timing of photosynthesis, with leaves emerging earlier in spring in the temperate and boreal zones. A longer growing season could mean greater carbon sequestration in forests, but the timing of leaves falling in autumn depends on multiple cues, making it difficult to predict. Zohner et al. investigated how leaf senescence relates to day length, temperature, and early-season photosynthesis across northern forests using remote sensing, ground observations, and experimental data. They found that warming had opposing effects on senescence dates depending on when it occurred: Warmer springs with higher photosynthesis correlated with earlier senescence, wheras warmer temperatures in autumn delayed senescence. Incorporating this shift in knowledge may improve predictions of vegetation response to climate change. ---BEL Early-season warming hastens onset and late-season warming extends duration of autumn leaf senescence in northern forests.},

@article{Norby2021,
	abstract = {Zani et al. (Research Articles, 27 November 2020, p. 1066) propose that enhancement of deciduous tree photosynthesis in a CO2-enriched atmosphere will advance autumn leaf senescence. This premise is not supported by consistent observations from free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments. In most FACE experiments, leaf senescence or abscission was not altered or was delayed in trees exposed to elevated CO2.},

@article{Zani2020,
	abstract = {The length of the growing season in temperate forests has been increasing under recent climate change because of earlier leaf emergence and later leaf senescence. However, Zani et al. show that this trend might be reversed as increasing photosynthetic productivity begins to drive earlier autumn leaf senescence (see the Perspective by Rollinson). Using a combination of experimental, observational, and modeling studies based on European forest trees, the researchers conclude that leaf senescence will advance by 3 to 6 days by the end of the 21st century rather than lengthening by 1 to 3 weeks as current phenological models have predicted. In turn, this predicted phenological pattern will limit the capacity of temperate forests to mitigate climate change through carbon uptake. Science, this issue p. 1066; see also p. 1030 Physiological constraints on the growing season and productivity may limit the capacity of temperate forests to retain carbon. Changes in the growing-season lengths of temperate trees greatly affect biotic interactions and global carbon balance. Yet future growing-season trajectories remain highly uncertain because the environmental drivers of autumn leaf senescence are poorly understood. Using experiments and long-term observations, we show that increases in spring and summer productivity due to elevated carbon dioxide, temperature, or light levels drive earlier senescence. Accounting for this effect improved the accuracy of senescence predictions by 27 to 42\% and reversed future predictions from a previously expected 2- to 3-week delay over the rest of the century to an advance of 3 to 6 days. These findings demonstrate the critical role of sink limitation in governing the end of seasonal activity and reveal important constraints on future growing-season lengths and carbon uptake of trees.},
